Planet-Plan
This project promotes sustainable habits by encouraging individuals to reduce their carbon footprint in a practical and accessible manner. This web-app allows users to share their progress in completing the tasks on the generated to-do lists on their profiles. Users can compete with each other by viewing the leaderboard, which displays the users who have made the most progress in their to-do list tasks. The social element of this application makes implementing eco-friendly practices fun and motivating. If widely adopted, this could have significant environmental impact. 

use npm install
npm install realm-web
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react
On the profile page, users can view and edit their own profile. Their profile photo and username will be displayed at the top of the page with the list of tasks under it. Each task will have a "more" button that users can click on to learn more about the task, how to do it, and how it reduces your carbon footprint. Each task will also have a "+" button to indicate that you have completed the task. 

On the home page, users can view activity from others as well as the leaderboard.
